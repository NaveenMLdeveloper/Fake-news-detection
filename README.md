# 📰 Fake News Detection Using Machine Learning

## 📝 Description
This project aims to identify fake news articles on the internet using machine learning techniques. It leverages an open-source dataset containing both fake and real news articles and applies various classification models to detect misinformation.

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ Data preprocessing and text cleaning
- 🤖 Machine learning-based classification
- 📊 Evaluation of multiple models for fake news detection
- 📈 Performance metrics visualization

## 📂 Dataset
We use an open-source dataset:
- 🟠 **Fake.csv** (contains fake news articles)
- 🔵 **True.csv** (contains real news articles)

The dataset is processed to remove unwanted features such as titles, subjects, and dates to focus on text-based analysis.

## 🏆 Machine Learning Models Used
The project evaluates multiple classification models:
- 🔹 Logistic Regression
- 🔹 Random Forest Classifier
- 🔹 Decision Tree Classifier
- 🔹 Gradient Boosting Classifier

## ⚙️ Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed. You can install the required dependencies using:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### ▶️ Running the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Fake-News-Detection.git
   cd Fake-News-Detection
   ```
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Flask API (if integrated):
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook fakenews.ipynb
   ```

## 🛠️ Usage
1. 📥 Load the dataset and preprocess the text.
2. 🎯 Train machine learning models for classification.
3. 📊 Evaluate model accuracy and classification reports.
4. 🔍 Predict whether a news article is real or fake.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- 🐍 Python
- 🤖 Scikit-learn
- 🏗️ Pandas, NumPy
- 📊 Seaborn, Matplotlib (for visualization)
- 🌐 Flask (if integrated with a web interface)
